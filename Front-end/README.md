Hello

i write this project with next.js, react-query, axios, adn chakra-ui(chakra-ui was built with tailwind),
unfortunetly becouase of my bad choosen (next.js with app router) i couldn't write mock api and prive route (next.js app router is beta version)
so i tried to run a express server and write the api on the backend, and i did it successfully(for first time) but i couldnt deploy it on herokuo server to online it, Heroku did not allow me to create an account to upload backend codes, it kept giving errors

so i uploaded both project in github and send to you 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
